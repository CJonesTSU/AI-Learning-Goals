I found my universitys AI courses to be very lacking so I made my own path to learn. This Repository is for my personal learning goals, however if you stumble upon this please feel free to join me and or include suggestions to improve :)

Warning it is very rigorous and I believe that the true way to learn AI is with a bottom up approach with a heavy emphaisis on statistical inference, calculus and linear algebra.
