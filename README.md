Papers i will read, implement and summarize possibly post on here in tex or medium post's

I want to implement a AI trading bot, for me to do so i want to learn The main techniques of  Multivariate Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Resampling Techniques, Tree-Based Methods (including Random Forests), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), Kernal Methods and Neural Networks.
